# Own changes

There are several changes in PyPhoon that were not present in the original Jef Pokazner's version of 1979:

* Localization: pyphoon is translated into many languages; language is configured using the system locale (`$LANG`)
* Hemisphere: pyphoon can show the moon as seen from the north or south hemisphere (south hemisphere is upside-down, waxes and wanes in the opposite direction).
